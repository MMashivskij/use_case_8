##  Application Description
This React application is designed with user-interactivity at its core. At its heart is a UserForm component, allowing users to input their first name, last name, email address, and a message. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, the form comes integrated with robust validation checks, preventing the input of erroneous data. Once the user submits valid data, it gets stored and can be viewed in the ItemList component. The ItemList is a dynamic component that showcases a table of the user-submitted data, updating in real-time as more entries are added. By using the Redux store, the application maintains a consistent state, enabling seamless data sharing between components.
